# chomppa
Modified version of the Chomp GroupMe robot written by noeltrivedi found at https://github.com/noeltrivedi/beer_pong_bot

Chomps is a GroupMe bot written in Python which can log and track beer pong stats for multiple players, and create/update a Google sheet containing stats for all players. It was designed to be simple enough for someone several games deep to use it, while still providing enough functionality to make it a useful tool.

Chomppa is modified to log and track Snappa/Beer die stats for multiple players.
